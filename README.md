# naga-project

My attempt on the Naga website for the Digital Tree/Ergodotisi.com hiring process.

This was my first interaction with Drupal and I did my best to learn as much as possible in the timeframe I was given. 
Unfortunately, I was confused and spent most the time going through the Drupal 9 tutorials where there was no in-depth training.

I only found the Drupal 8 tutorials 1 day before the deadline, where more in depth training was included regarding creating custom themes and formatting.

I tried to follow the tutorials that were provided through OSTraining regarding the design of the website,
but I came across some problems while trying to apply the CSS formatting.

The website looks fully unformatted even though I created the required .yml files as shown in the tutorials.
